        <p>Nalanda University is an ancient university in India, it is over 800 years as a major center for buddhist learning, drawing scholars from across Asia.<br>
        It was destroyed around 1193 by Bakhtiyar Khilji and was later revived in modern times, leading to the establishment of a new Nalanda University in 2010 as an international, postgraduate, research-intensive istitution.</p>
        <a href="#">History of Nalanda University</a><br><br>
        <blockquote>"Nalanda is more than a name; it"s a mantra, an identity, a declaration that books might get destroyed in fire, but knowledge persists," said by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.<br>
        Nalanda as the "Havard, Oxbridge, Nasa of its day" and the "heart of the intellectual exchange between India and the rest of the world".</blockquote>
